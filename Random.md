### Nicole:
This weekend I need to work on my BIS 180L labs and catch up on homework that I missed because I was sick.

### Juiln:
This weekend I hope to:
* finish my taxes (and my Mom's taxes)
* prepare for next week's BIS180L
* so a little coding for some projects that I am working on
* have a little fun: bike, sail, or ski...
